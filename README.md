# Digital Local News for Underserved Communities

## Title ##

## Overview Page ##

## Short description of what you aimed to accomplish ##
I listed out the following goals for this project:
1. Increase my comfort level analyzing data using pandas. My first project was more linear and mainly followed the lessons and homework. 
2. Try using a new graphing tool other than Datawrapper. Interested particularly in using D3.
3. Create a new type of graph that was not a pie, line, scatter, etc.
4. Use Figma to customize graph and export into HTML (use figma2html).

## Short description of your findings ##
**Graph 1: Digital Local News in last 10 years**

**Graph 2: Revenue Source & Distribution**

## Overview of the data analysis process ##

## A section about what new skills, approaches, etc you used, or where you grew the most during the project ##
1. Cleaning data using pandas
2. Explored other resources for creating a sankey graph, including a Google template. 
3. Used Figma to annotate the google template sankey and a RAWGraphs Sankey. The Google template, while more simple to hard code my findings into the code, was more difficult to annotate in Figma to do the fragmented components. RAWGraphs was A LOT easier to annotate, but it may also have been because it was my second time around.


## A section about things you tried to do or wanted to do but did not have the skills/time (but if you have more time you might do) ##
1. I wanted to use D3 to create my graphs, but the code was much too difficult to use. I would love to be able to use this tool if I had more time.
2. My second graph, the beeswarm, was a lot simpler. I didn't clean the data very much. Ideally, I would have been able to find a second data source for non-digital local news and compared their revenue sources and founding date to the digital version. A comparison to understand how the funding differs for digital vs. print would have been more insightful, but I didn't have the time for all of those steps.
3. I wanted to apply web scraping to this project, but this database didn't require this and would have overextended me. My main focus was to build upon my previous pandas skills, clean data, and explore new ways to build graphs and annotate using Figma.

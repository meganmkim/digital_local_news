                <p class="article__text">Traditional print for reporting local news has taken a consequential hit over the more recent years, but the exponential advancement of technology has provided potential opportunities to fill this void. Local news is particularly important in stimulating civic engagement, holding governments accountable, and providing alternative opinions that counter the effects of polarization (American Journalism Project - - https://www.theajp.org/why-local-news/).</p>

                <p class="article__text">Yet, 1,800 communities have lost their local newsroom since 2004 (UNC -https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/). A great deal of these closures can likely be attributed to the significant loss of advertising and subscription revenue streams. Most of the local print newspapers’ revenue stemmed from advertising and subscriptions, but the revenue of advertising, for example, has dropped by 80%. (American Journalism Project)</p>

                <h2> Tech Giants Remove News' Main Revenue</h2>

                <p class="article__text">Ironically, technology is both the perpetrator—Google and Facebook’s monopoly over advertisements has impacted newspapers’ revenue stream—and the solution. Nearly nine out of ten Americans currently obtain some local news digitally <a href ="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2019/03/26/for-local-news-americans-embrace-digital-but-still-want-strong-community-connection/">Pew Research  </a>. The tendency to read local news on social media is even higher for younger readers and in communities where there is a higher proportion of Hispanic and Black residents <a href ="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2019/03/26/overall-social-media-plays-a-moderate-role-in-local-news/">Pew Research  </a>. There is an emerging demand that needs to be met as more Americans, particularly in communities that are underrepresented, seek out local news digitally. The question is, how can these digital local news organizations that purposefully seek to serve these communities succeed during a declining trend of local news?

                </div>

                <p class="article__text">As seen in the graph above, digital local news organizations serving underrepresented populations were sparse in the last couple decades of the 20th century (or they didn’t survive), but in the past fifteen years there has been a significant uptick of newly founded organizations. [edit] Most of the earlier founded organizations still relies heavily on advertisements for their main source of revenue. While that holds true for more recently founded news, there is also an increased reliance on a less common revenue source: foundations and corporations. The dependency on grants, philanthropic funding from institutions, and foundation funding has serious implications on editorial decisions and content as well as the sustainability of these organizations.</p>

                <p class="article__text">Using Project News Oasis’ data, we analyzed the dataset for 98 organizations to understand their main revenue source. While advertising is still a core revenue, a good portion of the organizations seem to rely upon foundation funding, philanthropic giving from corporations, and individual donors. Unfortunately, these new forms rely upon money given from a third-party source in the form of donations and grants, which is not conducive for long-term success if organizations fail to establish a self-sustaining revenue.</p>

                <p class="article__text">Understanding the flow of money that provides digital local news and their distribution methods identifies the types of organizations that receive the most funding. Ones that focus on distributing the local news through websites and social media tend to also make money successfully through advertisements or appeal to potential donors. When the funding shifts focus to another industry, the local news organizations that rely heavily on donors will need to have other streams of revenue to survive. Otherwise, we will be left with yet an even larger news desert.</p>
